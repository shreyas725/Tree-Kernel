# Tree-Kernel
Custom Tree Kernel Machine Learning Library

These kernels measure a sort of similarity between pairs of trees that is proportional to the number of shared tree fragments. In particular a TreeRepresentation models a tree structure that can be employed for representing syntactic trees. Tree nodes are associated with a generic structure (StructureElement) that can be typed and it can contains also additional information. The TreeRepresentation is exploited by tree kernels in kernel-based methods.
